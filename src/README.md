HELPME_
by Sestren - 48 Hour Compo Entry

Have you ever wanted to get a high score? What if your life depended on it?

You are a researcher who has accidentally been shrunken down in size. Luckily, hidden away inside of one of your favorite classic game cartridges is an easter egg that will send out a distress beacon. But, in order to activate it, you must get a high score and enter "HELPME" at the name submission screen. That won't be easy, since using the game's controller now requires lots of extra legwork now that you're only a couple of inches tall.

Don't forget to bring your supply of shrunken experimental baseballs; they will help you hit buttons very quickly that are far away from you.

Controls for "INVADER" are as follows:

Move with the D-Pad
Shoot with the B Button
Activate your shields with the A Button. Shields last for 2 seconds, and recharge after 15 seconds.
Respawn after a death with the Start Button
Select Button (as usual) does nothing

Bug Fix (04/30/2013 1:47 PM CST): The enemy spawning time multiplier was not properly being reset after a Game Over, resulting in the game's difficulty setting remaining stuck for longer than it should be. This resulted in the need to reset the entire game in order to reset the difficulty. This has now been fixed as a potentially game-breaking bug. Since it doesn't affect anyone's playing the game the first time through, I hope fixing it doesn't disqualify my entry. Thank you, Jellycakes, for helping me find this bug.

Post-competition version: The "Web (Post-Compo)" link will always point to the latest version of the game, so check back in the coming weeks for updates or follow me on Twitter, @JshCrrgn.
